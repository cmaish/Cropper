Cropper
=======

__NOTE__: I'm not the original developer in charge of 
the Cropper project (http://cropper.codeplex.com) from
which this project is based off from. The reason 
for this fork to exist is that it seems that the
current project's admin is really busy and can't
commit patches that are sent his way. This fork will
provide the patched binaries/installer until they make it
to the trunk over in codeplex. Feel free to do pull requests
and I'll make sure to post a patch over at codeplex to give
back to the original project.

Features added so far:

- __1.9.4-pl1__: added support for expanding the crop form to full
screen size. Previously the form had some limitations that made
it's maximum size be much smaller than the screen. This option
can be found in the Options window, in the "Capturing" tab,
under "Other Options" and it's called 
"Allow crop form to expand to the entire screen".
The setting is off by default to preserve Cropper's original
intended functionality out of the box.

- __1.9.4-p2__: added the ability to choose between F8 (default),
and Control+PrintScreen to bring up the crop form. This option
can be found in the Options window under "Capturing" tab under
"Hot Keys" and it's called "Ctrl+PrintScreen shows crop form".
This setting is off by default to preserve Cropper's original
intended functionality out of the box.

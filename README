I'm not the original developer in charge of 
the Cropper project (http://cropper.codeplex.com) from
which this project is based off from. The reason 
for this fork to exist is that it seems that the
current project's admin is really busy and can't
commit patches that are sent his way. This fork will
provide the patched binaries/installer until they make it
to the trunk over in codeplex. Feel free to do pull requests
and I'll make sure to post a patch over at codeplex to give
back to the original project.
